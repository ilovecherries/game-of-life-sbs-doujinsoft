sbs collab game of life

```c
// thanks :3
```

```c
// i feel like removing that u was just making fun of me :(
// also just realized this is using clang so i cant actually make
// inline functions so that's cool
// ?? just run gcc
// ok where is min max
//this is wrong near the edges but
//well, i guess it works nevermind
//usually you make the edges loop or something
```

```c
/////////#pra  gma omp parallel for reduction(+:neighbors)
// note: pragma balls broke everything
```

```c
// nvm wrong thinking in my head
// i might have fixed it by just not cheating
```

```c
//what's the sudo password
//need to think of initializing board or whatever
```

```c
// we have to initialize it somehow
// (i feel like i should make it so it toggles)
```

```c
// just to make testing easier, obviously there should be better input
// but F--- YOU !
```

```c
// oh i overthought this didnt i
// i couldve just had 3 dimensional array with one of them
// being the state 
//it is going to take me like 
// 3 hours to decide whether it's [2][size][size] or [size][size][2]
// lol
// FINAL_ANSWER
// THREE!
// woah learning in real time !

// wow this isnt as smooth as it looked in the animation
    
// im not sure... entirely... hmmmmmm, i 

//ok who has their indent set differently
// for me it inserts a tab idk how to even change that

// is twelve doing all the work for you
// pauses so that you can input things
// no, um, i just dont really know what theyre doing
// i'm just fixing the indents lol
// ok why do you use two tabs... it looks horrible on
// 4 indent size
// oh i had indent set to 2
// isn't that the default
// AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
/// oh i / well yesput 2
// tabs because/./ i didn't want to reindent that lol
// lol
```

```c
// we can simplify this later just let this work rn
// check for live cells first
// that was an issue
// lol that was bad
```

```c
// is this actually required?
// oh ok
// yes because newstate is just the same array we used last frame so it  has junk data in it
```

```c
// wait i had an idea in my head on how to do this but i actually
// have no idea how to do it in C uhhhhhhhh maybe i can just be awful
// oldstate = &newstate;
// no i didnt think
// ok im an idiot
// 
// need to make pointers to the arrays
// and then swap those
// 
// yeah, although im not 100% sure if that's what i want almost idk,,,
// wait does this actually work? huh. ok is there a way to access X or something
// for display. oh i wonder if some of the lag for the text is because of the
// x session actually lol

// yyyyyes
// but like
// hold on I'll make something uh
//	static cherry;
// static sue;
//static const _Complex unsigned long long ligma; //XD
```

```c
// oh cool static - i didnt mean you had to do that literally lol
// why is this undefined but it worked earlier ????
// (note: this sucks at high res)
// yes x and y are swapped here
```

```c
// oh i see where the indenting settings are now.
// if only x didnt take 3 hours to load....
```
